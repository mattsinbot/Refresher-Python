Here's a simple exercise to play around with some numpy concepts.

1. create a function that takes a 1-d array of floating point values,
x, and returns some mathematical operation on them (e.g. sin(x), or
something like that)

2. in your main program, create x as evenly spaced numbers between
some xmin and xmax

3. call your function on your vector x

4. compute the derivative of your function by differencing.  Remember
from calculus that f' = (f(x+h) - f(x))/h -- you can difference
adjancent function values

5. compare the numerical derivative you computed with the analytic
derivative (so you'll need to create an fprime(x) function too that
has the analytic derivative of your original function).
