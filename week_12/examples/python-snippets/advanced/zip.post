Here's another simple example that shows how to use zip() to merge two
lists, element by element into a list of tuples, and how to use the
".split()" method on a string to split it into its component words:

>>> a = range(10)
>>> print a
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> b = "this is my nice long string".split()
>>> print b
['this', 'is', 'my', 'nice', 'long', 'string']
>>> for n, w in zip(a, b):
   ....:     print n, w
   ....:
0 this
1 is
2 my
3 nice
4 long
5 string
