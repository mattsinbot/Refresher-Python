We briefly discussed shallow copies in class:

>>> a = [1, 2, [3,4], 5]
>>> b = a[:]
>>> print id(a)
140022054383056
>>> print id(b)
140022054485312
>>> 
>>> print a[2]
[3, 4]
>>> print id(a[2])
140022054381760
>>> print id(b[2])
140022054381760
>>> 
>>> 
>>> a[2][0] = "changed"
>>> print a
[1, 2, ['changed', 4], 5]
>>> print b
[1, 2, ['changed', 4], 5]

notice that the list in the list is not a copy, but they both point to
the same list, so this is shallow in that sense.
